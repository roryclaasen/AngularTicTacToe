## Rules

Ultimate TicTacToe is a 2-player computer game played on a game board comprising nine tic-tac-toe games set out in nine mini-squares within a 3x3 greater-square.  Thus, there are 81 cells, arranged in nine 3x3 mini-squares within a greater square.

### Objective:

The objective of this game is to be the first to win three tic-tac-toe games lying in a row, column, or diagonal within the greater-square.

### Rules of Play:

1.  The first player may place an "X" in any cell within any mini-square on the board.  
2.  The selected cell position within this mini-square corresponds to the mini-square position within the greater-square where the second player must then place an "O".
3.  Thereafter, the two players take turns placing their mark in any unfilled cell within the mini-square dictated by the cell position marked by the previous player.  For the first player, this mini-square will be outlined in red.
4.  The first tic-tac-toe winner in a mini-square remains the winner in that mini-square for the remainder of the game.
5.  If a player is sent to a mini-square in which all the cells are filled, the player may next place his mark in any unfilled cell in any other mini-board.
